I am Ph.D student in [Department of Mathematics](http://www.math.ust.hk/) at [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](http://www.ust.hk/), advised by [Shingyu Leung](http://www.math.ust.hk/~masyleung). Prior to this, I completed at [ZJNU](http://www.zjnu.edu.cn/) my B.S. degrees and M.S. degrees in Applied Mathematics(advised by Yong Zhou).

My research interest lies in computational numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs) and scientific computing. Personally, I also love the mathematical aspects of computer vision. I have recently been interested in mathematical computation for surface geometric structure. I have worked on image restoration and segmentation for face recognition and theoratial partial differential equations (PDEs) before.



Places at which I have worked before:

I had resided in Ningbo, China till 2006 since birth.
